# CSharp-DevOps-Suite

#### WORKING well enough you could use it, needs issues hammered out, no time right now

#### sln/csproj/cs files are just to make it easy to edit and manage git operations within the same IDE window

- This is a comprehensive test suite which performs many operations and generates reports of it's findings
- The special tool "Generate-Comprehensive-Report.ps1 will give a high level overview of project health
- There is also another special tool, Generate-CorruptionReport.ps1 run it and see how it looks :)
- You can then drill down to get more detail and resolve issues found within the reports.
- Reports can be automated via task I believe
- Nice menu for easy interaction, audit, and report generation
